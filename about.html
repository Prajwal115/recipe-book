        <p>This site was made with HTML, CSS and JS. The recipes were stored in a javascript array-object and the common field between all the scripts was the FoodID.<br>I thank the internet and all the authors from where the images have been used. This site was made for Educational Purposes only.  </p>
        <p>I thank Nishamadhulika.com for ease of all the recipes available there.</p>
