This is a recipe book made with HTML, CSS, JS and a little bit of PHP.
The adding recipe feature requires a server to be in place to serve the PHP files and execute them.

- Ensure you have PHP installed on your local machine. You can download PHP from [php.net](https://www.php.net/downloads) or install it via a package manager.

### Running the Server

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
2.  ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to view the website.    
To stop the server, press Ctrl/Cmd+C in the terminal.
